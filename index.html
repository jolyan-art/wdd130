    <p>Hello! My name is JOHN and I’m currently learning web development from Uganda. I enjoy creative coding projects
        and exploring how programming can solve real-world problems. I'm especially curious about making websites
        interactive and user-friendly!.</p>

    <p>Uganda is a country in East Africa known for its stunning natural beauty, diverse wildlife, and vibrant culture.
        It is home to Lake Victoria, the source of the Nile River, and offers lush landscapes, national parks, and
        welcoming communities. Kampala, the capital city, is a hub of business, education, and culture.</p>
