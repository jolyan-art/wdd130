                Uganda is a country in East Africa known for its stunning natural beauty, diverse wildlife, and vibrant
                culture.
                It is home to Lake Victoria, the source of the Nile River, and offers lush landscapes, national parks,
                and
                welcoming communities. Kampala, the capital city, is a hub of business, education, and culture.
